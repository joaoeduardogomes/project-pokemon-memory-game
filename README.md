# PokÃ©mon Memory Game **ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸**

This is a simple project of a memory game using pokÃ©mon theme.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project was to understand and implement the logic of a memory game while using the PokÃ©mon API to dynamically generate new cards.

## Lessons learned & challenges

Every step of this project was a challenge for me. From understanding how to fetch and display data from the API to implementing the game logic itself. The process involved creating the card-flipping effect, dynamically applying colors to the cards, managing the array of cards to be displayed, randomizing their order, and checking for matches. Each day brought a new challenge, but Iâ€™m proud to see the game working as intended.

## How to use

## Notes
